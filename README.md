# Machine Learning Project
Classification of handwritten arabic and chinese numbers.
Data preprocessing was needed to make the datasets compatible.
Handcrafted feature extraction and PCA are compared with 2 classification algorithms (SVM and Gradient Boosting). Additionally, a CNN was used.


To run the code you need to install the requirements:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

MNIST data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?select=mnist_train.csv. This is a processed version of http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

CHINESE numbers from Nazarpour, K; Chen, M (2017): Handwritten Chinese Numbers. Newcastle University. Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/chinese-mnist-digit-recognizer.
