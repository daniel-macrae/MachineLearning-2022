# Machine Learning Project
Classification of handwritten arabic and chinese numbers.
Data preprocessing was needed to make the datasets compatible.
Handcrafted feature extraction and PCA are compared with 2 classification algorithms (SVM and Gradient Boosting). Additionally, a CNN was used.


To run the code you need to install the requirements:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
